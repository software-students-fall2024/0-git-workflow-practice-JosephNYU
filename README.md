# Article I Find Interesting

What I find interesting about the article is that in the "Software Gap" section of the article, I share a common sentiment with the author in regards to the availability and selections of software between Mac computers and Windows computers. Having used both Mac and Windows computers, it is apparent that many of the software common for Windows are far different than what how it is run/formatted on Mac, and sometimes not available at all. The article mentions that Windows excels in gaming in terms of software availability, which holds true as many mainstream video games are rarely ever available on Mac whereas the opposite holds true on Windows.
