# Article I Find Interesting
[Link](https://www.wired.com/story/rant-switching-from-mac-to-windows/ "Switching from Mac to Windows")

What I find interesting about the article is that in the "Software Gap" section of the article, I share a common sentiment with the author in regards to the availability and selections of software between Mac computers and Windows computers. Having used both Mac and Windows computers, it is apparent that many of the software common for Windows are far different than what how it is run/formatted on Mac, and sometimes not available at all. The article mentions that Windows excels in gaming in terms of software availability, which holds true as many mainstream video games are rarely ever available on Mac whereas the opposite holds true on Windows.

## Stephen's Comment:
I also find the "Software Gap" section interesting. As a user of both operating systems, I find Windows to be far more cumbersome to work with and more visually unappealing. I have several times had to search deep into old forum posts and use archaic Windows applications to fix software incompatabilities or OS issues. I think that the appeal of Windows has always been more compatability with different hardware. It makes it a jack of all trades and a master of none. I understand the appeal, but for my professional and educational needs, I prefer the more streamlined and simple experience of macOS.
